Well, Derek is not around to talk about the scheduled topic, so we are doing a
Pot Luck meeting! Bring a 5 minute topic, trick, or tip to share with the
group. It can be a stupid command line trick, a free software project to
promote, or just a burning question about Linux stuff.

September 28, 2023, 7 PM to 9 PM EDT. See [Meetup]({{site.meetupurl}}).
