Knative is a serverless container platform that runs on Kubernetes clusters. Users create container images that are run on-demand and scale to zero, meaning you only use / pay for what you need. We'll be going through the Cloud Run tutorial using Golang with Google's hosted option for Knative. However, it is translatable to any language and cloud provider / on-prem Kubernetes cluster including minikube, which is a local installation of Kubernetes for running on developer machines. If there is interest in running it locally after seeing it in use on Google Cloud Run, we may schedule a further presentation on how to run it locally with minikube.
