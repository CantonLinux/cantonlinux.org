Ollama is a streamlined tool that brings the power of open-source large
language models (LLMs) to your local machine.In our present era of paid AI
services aiming to improve lives of end-users, Ollama makes it easier to run
LLMs on your own computer without needing a cloud service for no cost, allowing
users to evaluate the model’s strengths and weaknesses to determine whether the
model can be useful in their business contexts.

In this talk (mini-workshop rather) ‘G’ Gaurav Saxena (@gsvolt) will discuss:

- Basics of Ollama
- How to set it up on your system (Linux or Mac) and download models locally
- Download models and use Ollama to interact with them
- Explore Ollama’s REST API using cURL (and briefly explore a variety of tools building on top of it)
- How to create your own custom models with Ollama’s Modelfile

April 25, 2024, 7 PM to 9 PM EDT. See [Meetup]({{site.meetupurl}}).
