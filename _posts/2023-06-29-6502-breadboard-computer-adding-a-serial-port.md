Mike will be demonstrating progress on adding a serial port to the 6502
breadboard computer shown last year.  The port connects the 6502 computer to a
modern laptop/desktop over a USB-to-Serial cable. Eventually, this will let us
use and program the 6502 computer with a terminal emulator, such as GNU
Screen.
