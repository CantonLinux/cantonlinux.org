Mike will demo his homebrew minimal 8-bit breadboard computer using the classic
6502 microprocessor. This project is based on the excellent Ben Eater youtube
series on learning about computers by building them.

We will cover the basics of the classic 6502 microprocessor and demo how to
write machine code and assembly. Linux tools will be used on a separate laptop
for programming and debugging.

Thursday, July 28, 2022, 7 PM to 9 PM EDT. See [Meetup]({{site.meetupurl}}).
