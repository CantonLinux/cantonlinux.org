Mike Molnar presented systemd and journald concepts and examples.

Two daemons: systemd (aka pid 1) and journald
Two commands: systemctl and journalctl
Equals: a great deal of control over system initialization and visibility about its machinations.

## Tools

* journalctl
* journald
* systemctl
* systemd
