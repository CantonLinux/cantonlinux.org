In this session, we will be building a simple Linux kernel module and show how
to load and unload it in a running Linux kernel.  Bring a laptop which can
create Linux virtual machines to follow along.  (I'll be using vagrant with
libvirt, but you can use any virtualization provider you prefer.)

October 26, 2023, 7 PM to 9 PM EDT. See [Meetup]({{site.meetupurl}}).
