Derek Arnold explored the cross-pollination between Linux and Microsoft Windows.

The Micosoft powershell can be installed in Linux.  command: pwsh.

A Linux server can host a .net application on nginx or Apache.

Ansible can control Windows servers. As of this presentation, Windows cannot run an ansible server.

Run docker natively on Windows.

## Tools

* get-content = the powershell equivalent of Linux cat
* .net core for Linux
* c# for Linux
* WSL2 = Windows subsystem for Linux (only available on Windows 10, version 2004, build 1904 or higher)
