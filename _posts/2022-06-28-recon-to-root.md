Learn about the hacker methodology. See how Pentester Jarrod Rizor
goes about doing an external pentest from recon to enumeration to
exploitation using various linux tools and techniques. Live Demo of
exploiting a linux box and cracking WPA2 PSK.

After the demo/presentation, we will convene at George's (or Milestone) for
food and drinks.

Tuesday, June 28, 2022, 7 PM to 9 PM EDT. See [Meetup]({{site.meetupurl}}).
