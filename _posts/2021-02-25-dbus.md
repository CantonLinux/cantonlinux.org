description: The Linux d-bus message bus
---
D-bus is a simple way for desktop applications and system services to talk to one another and coordinate process lifecycles. D-Bus messaging system has been adopted by GNOME, KDE, Xfce, and systemd.

Dave Collins gave a live demonstration. He monitored d-bus messages from rhythmbox with d-feet. He identified the messages for soundtracks and incorporated the found methods in his custom python application.

Tools:

* tmux
* d-feet
* rhythmbox
* python

## d-feet

A graphical utility for analyzing d-bus methods and signals.
