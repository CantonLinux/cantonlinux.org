Elixir is a functional programming language built on top or Erlang.

If you love piping at the Linux command line, you are going to love Elixir!

Dennis Warner will demonstrate the differences between an object oriented
language like Ruby, to a functional programming language like Elixir.
Description

The talk will go over Elixir collection types, piping, pattern matching and recursion.

July 27, 2023, 7 PM to 9 PM EDT. See [Meetup]({{site.meetupurl}}).
