Mike will do a demo of the Proxmox VE system to manage KVM virtual machines. We
will install Proxmox on bare metal and get started creating new virtual
machines and linux containers.

This will be a very basic demo of the Proxmox VE system based on the excellent
LearnLinuxTV youtube video series by Jay LaCroix.

This will be a hybrid meeting. Zoom login will be provided on request (please
RSVP).

Thursday, January 27, 2022, 7 PM to 9 PM EDT. See [Meetup]({{site.meetupurl}}).
