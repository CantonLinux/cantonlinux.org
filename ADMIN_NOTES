20210701  (mjm) changed repository URL
          from https://cantonlinux.github.io/cantonlinux.org
          to   https://cantonlinux.github.io
          in order to support DNS access via cantonlinux.org
----------------------------------------------------------------------          
20210718  (mjm) changed repository URL
          back to https://cantonlinux.github.io/cantonlinux.org
          uncertain when the registrant for cantonlinux.org will
          respond in a meaningful manner to requests for change.
----------------------------------------------------------------------          
20210722  (mjm) registrant has updated the DNS records for
          cantonlinux.org (nsD.linode.com) to point to github.io IPs.
          updated custom domain to www.cantonlinux.org
          and enforced https, for proper certificate synthesis.
          cantonlinux.org now operational, hosted by github pages.
          A tip of the hat to the registrant, who graciously provided
          the DNS support of this site. By way -- my difficulties in 
          contacting the registrant were because I had the wrong phone
          number.
