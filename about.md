### About {{site.orgname}}

{{site.orgname}} is an informally-organized group of people who are active in the Free Software / Open Source software community located in or near Canton, Ohio, USA.

If you work in a Windows only shop and are absolutely certain you
will never use Linux, you need to join this group. Windows 10 has adopted
several features of Linux. You may as well learn about an opeating system
that strives to get the whole picture right.

If you are interested in getting started with Linux, you need to join this group. Our events promote a *no one left behind* attitude that can boost you along your journey.

If you are massively proficient at Linux and understand it inside and out
and think this group is just another LUG on the block â€¦ then yikes, you
need to join this group. Give a couple presentations. You are bound to learn
a thing or two.
