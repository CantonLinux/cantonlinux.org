# About {{site.orgname}}

This is an informally-organized group. We are active in the Free Software / Open Source software community around Canton, Ohio, USA.

If you work in a Windows only shop and are absolutely certain you
will never use Linux, you need to join this group. Microsoft Windows has adopted
many features of Linux. You will want to get the most out of those features and we can help with that. And once you get the hang of it, next thing you will want to run a Linux server, then several workstations.

If you are interested in getting started with Linux, you need to join this group. Our events promote a *no one left behind* attitude. Everyone learns something.

If you are massively proficient at Linux and understand it inside and out
and think this group is just another LUG on the block â€¦ then yikes, you
need to join this group. Give a couple presentations. You are bound to learn
a thing or two.
